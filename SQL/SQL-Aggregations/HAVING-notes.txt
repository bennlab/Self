HAVING - Expert Tip
HAVING is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery. 
Essentially, any time you want to perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate, you need to use HAVING instead.

HAVING appears after the GROUP BY clause, but before the ORDER BY clause.
HAVING is like WHERE, but it works on logical statements involving aggregations.
