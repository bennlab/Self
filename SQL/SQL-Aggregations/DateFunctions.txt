The first function you are introduced to in working with dates is DATE_TRUNC.

DATE_TRUNC allows you to truncate your date to a particular part of your date-time column. Common trunctions are day, month, and year. Here is a great blog post by Mode Analytics on the power of this function.

DATE_PART can be useful for pulling a specific portion of a date, but notice pulling month or day of the week (dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years in order. Rather you are grouping for certain components regardless of which year they belonged in.

For additional functions you can use with dates, check out the documentation here, but the DATE_TRUNC and DATE_PART functions definitely give you a great start!

You can reference the columns in your select statement in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses with numbers that follow the order they appear in the select statement. For example

SELECT standard_qty, COUNT(*)

FROM orders

GROUP BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)

ORDER BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)
